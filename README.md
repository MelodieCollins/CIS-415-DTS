# CIS-415-DTS
This program builds a Distributed Time Server (DTS); each version provides an 
increasingly complex set of capabilities. 
There are 3 parts to this project. The objectives of the project are to gain experience writing a 
distributed server that meets a specification, practice using priority queues, maps, and 
queues to construct a significant application, and familiarity with different programming 
notions of time in Linux and C.
